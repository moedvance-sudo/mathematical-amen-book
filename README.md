This book is a live repository: copy, fork, run.  
Inside you will find prompts, spreadsheets, and terraform files that turn the sermon “give and it shall be given” into a coefficient λ_shock you can slide in Looker Studio while the city council watches the upside tail grow.  
We call the moment the advantage estimator stays positive the Mathematical Amen.  
May your dashboards overflow.
